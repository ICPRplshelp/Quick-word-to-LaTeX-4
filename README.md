# Quick word to LaTeX
A Microsoft Word to LaTeX converter which extends Pandoc 
by adding a lot of useful features and removes quirks 
that pandoc produces.

## Usage
Make sure Python 3.10 is installed on your computer.
No external packages are required, but pandoc
and LaTeX should be installed on your computer.

I've only tested this for Windows 10. I am unsure
how this works for macOS.

1. Run `main.py`.
2. Choose the Word file you want to convert when
prompted to.
3. The program will convert it and output
a PDF in the same directory as `main.py`.

You should look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/ICPRplshelp/Quick-word-to-LaTeX-4/wiki)
if you want to make the most use of this program.
